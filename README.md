## Component libraries built on top of Tailwind CSS

- [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/components/preview)
  - Pros:
    - Paid components by Tailwind team. No one knows Tailwind CSS better than the framework creator.
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/react/menu)
  - Pros:
    - Open-source components by the Tailwind team. Beautiful.
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/#components)
  - Pros:
    - Rich open-source components.
    - Rich paid blocks(large page sections).
  - Cons:
    - More action buttons are on the left. Several bugs are not fixed even after I communicated with the team many times.
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/)
  - Pros & cons:
  - Bold default color, [some uncommon component design](https://daisyui.com/components/tab/?lang=en)
